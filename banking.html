        // by leaving it at 1, it means we're setting it to compound annually

        const interest = this.balance * Math.pow((1 + rate / n), n * years); // the constant 'interest' is defined here to store the result
        // of the interets calculation. 'Math.pow' is a JS function that raises a number to a specified power. The base form for it is
        // 'Math.pow(base, exponent)'. The base is calculated by taking the rate and dividing it by 'n' which in this case will just equal the rate.
        // 1 is added to represent the principal amount. 'n*years' just calculates the exponent. In this formula, it takes the number of years and
        //  multiplies it by the number of times that the interest rate is compounded per year. 'this.balance' is then multiplied to the calculated factor
        // and taaadaaa, we have earned interest.

    // toFixed(2) turns the number into a string and also presents it with only 2 decimal places
        console.log(`Balance after 3 years with interest: $${interest.toFixed(2)}`);
